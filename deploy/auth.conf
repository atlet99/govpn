# GoVPN Basic Authentication Configuration
# Password hashing and session settings

# === BASIC AUTHENTICATION ===
# Enable password authentication
auth-user-pass-verify scripts/auth-user.sh via-env  # Password verification script
auth-user-pass-optional false                       # Password is required

# Password hashing method
auth-hash-method argon2                             # Hashing method (argon2/pbkdf2)

# Argon2 settings (recommended method)
auth-argon2-memory 65536                            # Memory for Argon2 in KB (64MB)
auth-argon2-time 3                                  # Number of Argon2 iterations
auth-argon2-threads 4                               # Number of Argon2 threads
auth-argon2-key-length 32                           # Argon2 key length in bytes

# PBKDF2 settings (alternative method)
auth-pbkdf2-iterations 100000                       # Number of PBKDF2 iterations
auth-pbkdf2-key-length 32                           # PBKDF2 key length in bytes

# General settings
auth-salt-length 16                                 # Salt length in bytes
auth-session-timeout 3600                          # Session timeout in seconds (1 hour)

# Session security settings
auth-token                                          # Enable tokens for reconnection
auth-retry interact                                 # Authentication retry mode
auth-nocache                                        # Don't cache passwords on client

# Session key rotation  
reneg-sec 3600                                      # Regenerate keys every hour

# User file (if using file-based authentication)
# auth-user-pass-file users.txt                     # File with username:password

# Additional script connections
# learn-address scripts/learn-address.sh             # Address learning script
# client-connect scripts/client-connect.sh           # Client connection script  
# client-disconnect scripts/client-disconnect.sh     # Client disconnection script

# Authentication logging
log-append /var/log/govpn-auth.log                 # Authentication log file

# Authentication script examples:
# scripts/auth-user.sh - should return 0 for successful authentication
# Environment variables: username, password, untrusted_ip, untrusted_port

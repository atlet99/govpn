## Project Vision

GoVPN aims to become an **evolution of OpenVPN**, preserving its time-tested concepts while addressing shortcomings. We are not reinventing VPN from scratch, but modernizing existing standards. Our approach focuses on:

1. **Compatibility with OpenVPN ecosystem** - preserving core concepts and compatibility with existing clients
2. **High performance** - optimized Go code for improved connection processing speed
3. **Modern security** - built-in OIDC, MFA mechanisms and protection against modern threats
4. **Deployment flexibility** - from single installations to Kubernetes clusters
5. **Management simplicity** - powerful CLI, REST API and intuitive web panel while maintaining familiar configuration

## Hybrid Approach: Preserving the Best of OpenVPN

| Aspect | What we preserve from OpenVPN | What we improve in GoVPN |
|--------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Protocol | Basic OpenVPN protocol for compatibility | Go packet processing optimization |
| Configuration | Configuration file format | Additional options and simplified management |
| PKI Infrastructure | Certificate handling principles | Modern cryptographic primitives |
| Client compatibility | Support for existing OpenVPN clients | New optimized Go client |
| Security model | Basic trust model | Extended authentication capabilities |

| LDAP integration | Complex setup | Simplified integration while preserving familiar model |
| Scaling | Limited | Improved clustering support with single installation compatibility |
| API | Limited | Full REST API for automation plus classic management methods |
| Monitoring | Basic | Extended Prometheus metrics while preserving basic logging model |
| Database | File system | PostgreSQL with option to use classic file storage |
